Prerequisites:
•	Windows 11 operating system (32-bit or 64-bit)
•	Internet connection for download
Steps:
1.	Visit the official VS Code download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2.	Click the "Download for Windows" button. The installer is a .zip file.
3.	Double-click the downloaded .zip file.
4.	Extract the contents to a desired location (e.g., C:\Program Files\VS Code). This creates a folder containing VS Code executables.

2. First-time Setup:
Initial Configurations:
•	Theme: Choose a theme that suits your preferences (dark, light, high-contrast) from the Settings menu (File > Preferences > Settings).
 
•	Font Size: Adjust the font size for better readability in the Settings menu (File > Preferences > Settings, search for "Font Size").
•	Extensions: Install essential extensions for your development needs.

Extensions:
•	HTML: Provides language support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Live Server: Enables live preview of web pages in the browser as you code.
•	Debugger for Chrome/Firefox: Allows debugging web applications directly in VS Code.




3. User Interface Overview:
Main Components:
•	Activity Bar (left): Provides quick access to views like Source Control, Extensions, and Terminal.
•	Side Bar (left): Displays the Explorer (file and folder management), Search, and Debug views.
•	Editor Group (center): Holds your open code files. You can have multiple editor groups.
•	Status Bar (bottom): Shows information like current line number, indentation mode, and Git integration status.
4. Command Palette:
The Command Palette is a powerful tool for finding and executing VS Code commands.
Access:
•	Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) 
Examples:
•	Open a new file: type "New File" and press Enter.
•	Search for a setting: type "Settings" and press Enter, then search for the specific setting.
•	Install an extension: type "Extensions" and press Enter, then search for and install the desired extension.
5. Extensions in VS Code:
Extensions extend VS Code's functionality with new features and languages.
Finding and Installing:
1.	Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
 
2.	Browse by category or search for specific extensions.
 

3.	Click the "Install" button next to the desired extension.
Managing Extensions:
•	The Extensions view shows installed extensions.
•	Click the gear icon for an extension to disable, uninstall, or reload it.
6. Integrated Terminal:
Opening and Using:
1.	Go to the Terminal menu (top bar) or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Terminal: New Terminal."
2.	The integrated terminal opens at the bottom of the VS Code window.
3.	Run commands in the terminal as you would in a standalone terminal (e.g., cd, git).
Advantages:
•	Seamless integration with VS Code: Run commands directly related to your project, get output within the editor.
•	File system navigation: Easily navigate between project directories using terminal commands.
•	Built-in tasks: Run build scripts, linters, and other tasks directly from the terminal within VS Code.
7. File and Folder Management:
Creating, Opening, and Managing:
•	Create Files/Folders: Right-click in the Explorer (Side Bar), select "New File" or "New Folder."
 
•	Open Files: Double-click a file in the Explorer or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to search for a file.
•	Manage Files/Folders: Right-click on a file or folder to rename, move, delete, or open its context menu with additional options.
Efficient Navigation:
•	Go to File: Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Go to File" to quickly open a specific file by name.
•	Recent Files: Access recently opened files from the File menu or the Quick Access view 

8. Settings and Preferences:
Finding and Customizing:
1.	Open the Settings menu (File > Preferences > Settings).
2.	Search for specific settings or browse through categories.
3.	Double-click on a setting to change its value. There might be dropdown menus or text input fields for customization.
Examples:
•	Theme: Search for "Theme" and choose your preferred theme (e.g., Dark+, Light Theme).
•	Font Size: Search for "Font Size" and adjust the value to your liking.
•	Keybindings: Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts" to view and edit keyboard shortcuts for various actions. You can also search for specific actions and modify their keybindings.
9. Debugging in VS Code:
Setting Up:
1.	Make sure your language has a debugger extension installed (e.g., Debugger for Chrome for JavaScript).
2.	Create a launch configuration file (usually launch. Json) to define how to launch your program for debugging. This often involves specifying the program's entry point and any arguments.
Starting Debugging:
1.	Open the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2.	Select the appropriate launch configuration.
3.	Click the "Run" button (green play triangle) or press F5 to start debugging.
4.	Set breakpoints by clicking in the margin next to lines of code where you want to pause execution.
5.	Use the debugging controls (e.g., step over, step into, step out, pause) to navigate through your code and inspect variables.
 





10. Using Source Control (Git):
Integrating Git:
1.	Install the Git SCM extension (usually pre-installed). This adds Git functionality to VS Code.
2.	Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Git: Initialize Repository." This creates a Git repository in your project folder.
Making Commits and Pushing:
1.	Make changes to your code files.
2.	Stage changes you want to commit: Right-click on a file and select "Git: Stage Changes," or use the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) to stage specific lines or files.
3.	Commit staged changes: Type a commit message in the Source Control view, then click the commit button (check mark icon).
4.	Push changes to a remote repository (like GitHub): In the Source Control view, find the "Push" section and click the "Push to origin" button (or provide the remote URL). This uploads your committed changes to the remote repository.
